1) create environment "AVIATOR":
	conda create -n AVIATOR
2) activate environment:
	conda activate AVIATOR
3) install packages:
	conda install -c conda-forge spyder=5.3.3
	conda install -c conda-forge numpy
	conda install -c conda-forge pandas
	conda install -c conda-forge matplotlib
	conda install -c conda-forge geopandas
	conda install -c conda-forge bokeh
	pip install FlightRadarAPI
4) make sure that the "main-path" is listed in sys.path (only required - by now - if you want to use testing methods):
	- as example: If you're using a anaconda environment, add conda.pth in the environment (set the environment as developing environment)
	instructions:

   in Anaconda: how to add AVIATOR to the path-variables:
	(in order to import all AVIATOR modules as e.g. from aviator.code import xyz):
	- add the file "conda.pth" to the folder where the AVIATOR environment is saved
	(e.g. "C:\Anaconda\envs\AVIATOR\Lib\site-packages")
	- add the path of the parent directory of the path where you installed AVIATOR
	(e.g. "C:\software" <-- if AVIATOR is located at "C:\software\AVIATOR")
	NOTE: using conda.pth you are not adding this path to sys.path!
