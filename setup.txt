1) create environment "AVIATOR":
	conda create -n AVIATOR
2) activate environment:
	conda activate AVIATOR
3) install packages:
	conda install -c conda-forge spyder=5.3.3
	conda install -c conda-forge numpy
	conda install -c conda-forge pandas
	conda install -c conda-forge matplotlib
	conda install -c conda-forge geopandas
	conda install -c conda-forge bokeh
	pip install FlightRadarAPI
4) make sure that the "main-path" is listed in sys.path (only required - by now - if you want to use testing methods):
	- as example: If you're using a anaconda environment, add conda.pth in the environment (set the environment as developing environment)
